# System_Monitor
Widget that displays CPU and RAM, and storage usage written entirely in python. This program
is meant to be a lightweight monitor to view the load of the CPU and RAM while also displaying
CPU temperature and storage usage.

To keep the file size down, you will need to use pyinstaller in order to make this an executable
program. To do this, just pip install pyinstaller, cd into the directory that houses the program,
and use ``` pyinstaller program_name ``` from there it will add a dist folder where the executable
will be.
